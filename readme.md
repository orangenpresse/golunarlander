# Go Lunar Lander

> Lunar Lander Clone, a small project to get deeper into Golang and OpenGL.

## Getting Started
To install, clone the repository and get the dependencies with go get.
For more information see https://github.com/go-gl/gl and https://github.com/go-gl/glfw

## Tested
It was tested under MacOSX 10.11.01

## TODO
The Game still lacks of some main features. The graphic should be improved, also it needs a better surface.
Also we added some network code, but there is also much room for improvement.
